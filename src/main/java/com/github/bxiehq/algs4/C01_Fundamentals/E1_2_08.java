/**
 * Suppose that a[] and b[] are each integer arrays consisting of millions of inte-
 * gers. What does the follow code do? Is it reasonably efficient?
 * int[] t = a; a = b; b = t;
 *
 * Answer. It swaps them. It could hardly be more efficient because it does so by copying
 * references, so that it is not necessary to copy millions of elements.
